# About Python Programming?
Python is high level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language with dynamic semantics. It has a high built-in data structure which makes it very useful and attractive for quick application development. The syntax of the Python programming language is easy to read and understand, which reduces the cost of programming maintenance. It has a large collection of modules and packages which helps program modularity and reuse of code. Python extensive standard library and python interpreter are available in binary form as well as source code for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.

# Difficult Python Concepts

Here are some difficult python concepts where students seek python online help:

1. Data Types: Python programming language comes with a large set of data structure which contains a different type of variables. Some of them are number, string, list, tuple, set, dictionary, Boolean, etc.
2. Loops: Loops are the conditional statement that is executed as long as the conditional statement returns true.
3. Functions: A function is a group of statements in a program that can perform a specific task. Using function reduces the error in code and also it helps in reducing the size of code as instead of writing the same code again and again in program.
4. File Operation: Python provides many default functions and methods to do the necessary task in the files. To use them we can use the file object.
5. Classes: Class help to describe the object in sense of its description, blueprint, or definition but it separates the object itself.

# Advantages and Features of Python Programming
Below are the top 8 features of python programming:

1. Python is an open-source language and free of cost

You can easily download the python compiler and install it on any major OS from its official website for free of cost.

2. Python is easy to learn, code, and implement

Python possesses very easy and simple syntax which is suitable for beginners to learn. It quite resembles the English language and can be used in most advanced coding techniques.

3. Python is fast, flexible, and portable

Due to its easy and simple syntax, it is easy for beginners to understand faster in comparison to other programming languages. Also, python codes are portable and hence can be compiled on any platform.

4. Python supports multiple domains

Python provides an extensive library collection, including the modules like GUI, Networking, Web Development, and much more. This library helps the coder to program their requirements easily and efficiently.

5. Python supports scientific libraries

Python not only consists of 3rd party packages but also supports the scientific libraries which help in data analysis and data mining processes. All these libraries help in clearing the blocks formed in statistical data modeling by using the libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, etc.

6. Python follows both procedural and OOP programming

Generally, every programming language is either procedural or object-oriented. However, python is both of them. This feature of python gives it a cutting edge to work with simple as well as complex and complicated problems.

7. Interpreted language

Python is interpreted language which means python directly executed the code line by line. When the error is encountered, it stops executing the further line of code and report backs the error to the programmer.

8. Dynamically typed

Python does not know the type of variable until the code is executed. During execution, it allocates the data type automatically. The programmer is not required

# Challenges Faced By Students While Working on Python Assignments
Beginners may encounter numerous flaws and problems when using Python, leading them to believe that Python is a difficult programming language. The following are some of the most typical Python issues that beginners face:

1) Setting up the environment

Setting up the work environment to satisfy all the coding criteria is essential. Beginners always find it difficult in setting up all of this essential environment which can ultimately demotivate them at the initial stage of programming.

2) Deciding what to write

It is no secret that computers do not work well as humans do and therefore, they need to be told about their tasks at every stage. Most beginners struggle with deciding what to write to make their code work. Every word you type into the code will cause it to behave in a certain way, increasing the likelihood of mistakes and the complexity of developing the code.

3) Compiler Errors

Beginners are unaccustomed to executing tasks and creating code, and they may panic if they encounter compiler problems during the execution of their code.

4) Debugging the code

Because beginners are unfamiliar with the syntax, they may make mistakes that cause complications. Making syntax mistakes is a frequent mistake that may be decreased with practice and time. Debugging is an important aspect of the learning process since it helps the learner comprehend the difficulties that may arise as a result of these little errors, which helps them produce better code in the future.
